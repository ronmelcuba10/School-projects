The input is an N by N matrix of nonnegative integers. Each individual row is a decreasing sequence from left to right. Each individual column is a decreasing sequence from top to bottom. Implement in Java an O(N) worst-case algorithm that decides if a number x is in the matrix. Please include in the header of your Java program (using comments) the main ideas of your algorithm. Example of the 4 x 4 matrix:

    |26 22  17  10|
    |19 16  12  7 |
    |12 10  7   4 |
    |5  4   2   1 |

The Fibonacci sequence {fib}i≥1 is defined recursively as follows:

    fib(1) = 1, fib(2) = 1 and, fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) for n ≥ 3.
The numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are called the Fibonacci numbers, for example:

    {1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233,…}
* (a) Implement a sub-linear time complexity function in Java. 
    int fib(int n)
that returns the nth Fibonacci number. Example: fib(9) returns 34.
* (b) What is the running time complexity of your function? Justify.

Very important!
* Your Java program should print correctly the fib(250):     
 **fib(250) = 7896325826131730509282738943634332893686268675876375**
* In the resolution of this problem it is not allowed (and is not a good idea) to use the Binet's formula.
